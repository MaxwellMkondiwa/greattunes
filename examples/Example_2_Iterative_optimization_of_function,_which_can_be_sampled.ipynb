    "# Example 2: Iterative optimization of a function, which can be sampled\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook the framework is used to iteratively optimize a function which can be sampled. For simplicity we will use a known function to illustrate, but it is not a requirement that the function can be written down explicitly as we do below. Hence, this option of using the framework allows for optimizing _unknown_ functions or _functions without explicit definitions_ and will come in handy for e.g. optimizing complex experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will use the same function as for Example 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = - (6x - 2)^2 \\sin{(12 x - 4 )}, \\quad x \\in [0; 1].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that the function above has its maximum at $x^* = 0.75725$; the only covariate is $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framework approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leverage the iterative optimization approach of the framework which requires using the methods `.ask` and `.tell`. This approach allows for iterative optimization and optimization of any callable function, known or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization process can be stopped after any number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical note\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation of `torch` and `torchvision` (required dependencies) cannot be bundled as part of the `creative_project` installable. This is unfortunate, but a known issue it seems. Therefore these must be installed first, before installing `creative_project`."
