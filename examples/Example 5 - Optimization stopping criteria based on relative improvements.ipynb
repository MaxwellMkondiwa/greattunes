    "# Example 5: Stopping optimization based on relative improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "In this advanced example we show how to work with the convergence rate to increae the speed of reaching a solution  (fewer steps). During normal application, the `.auto` method will take a pre-specified number of iterations before stopping. Here, by monitoring the relative improvement in best guess for the maximum response, the algorithm is stopped when the relative improvement falls below a limit `rel_tol`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations for estimating convergence based on relative improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the Bayesian optimization approach used by this library works by iteratively making a model-driven guess of which data point to sample (determined by the *acquisition function*) and subsequently adjusting its understanding of the hidden function producing the response (the *surrogate model*, which is input to the acquisition function). At each iteration the framework stores the best response found across all sampling points (in the `best_response_value` attribute), but there is no guarantee that the response is better than at previous steps; in fact, it is not uncommon to find that the best response value plateaus for a few consecutive iterations before a sampling point is reached which improves it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the relative improvement in best response to stop the iterations of the optimization, one needs to be mindful of this plateauing. This example illustrates how to use the framework to address this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem solved in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will illustrate how to use relative improvement by optimizing this known function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = - (6x - 2)^2 \\sin{(12 x - 4 )}, \\quad x \\in [0; 1].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that the function above has its maximum at $x^* = 0.75725$ with a corresponding response of $f(x^*) = 6.02073$; the only covariate is $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will solve it using the `.auto`-method in and apply conditions on the relative improvement and illustrate their impact on covergence for two different cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. set the `rel_tol` argument to stop as soon as the relative improvement between two consecutive steps falls below the user-defined limit\n",
    "2. use `rel_tol_steps` argument together with `rel_tol` to require that the relative improvement must be below `rel_tol` for `rel_tol_steps` consecutive steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical note\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation of `torch` and `torchvision` (required dependencies) cannot be bundled as part of the `creative_project` installable. This is unfortunate, but a known issue it seems. Therefore these must be installed first, before installing `creative_project`."
