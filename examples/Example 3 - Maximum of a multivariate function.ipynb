    "# Example 3: Maximization of a multivariate function \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook the framework is used to optimize a function which depends on two variables $x_0$ and $x_1$. We illustrate both closed-loop and iterative approaches to solving the optimization problem using our framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Example 2, we use here a known function to illustrate how the framework is applied, but it is not a requirement for the framework that the function can be written down explicitly as we do below. Hence, this option of using the framework allows for optimizing _unknown_ functions or _functions without explicit definitions_ and will come in handy for e.g. optimizing complex experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will maximize the Easom function, a classical optimization test function\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x}) = - \\cos{(x_0)} \\, \\cos{(x_1)} \\, \\mathrm{e}^{-(x_0 - x_0^*)^2 - (x_1 - x_1^*)^2}, \\quad \\mathbf{x} = [x_0, x_1].\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that the function above has its maximum at $\\mathbf{x}^* = (x_0^*, x_1^*)$ (typical values used for the minimum are $\\mathbf{x}^* = (\\pi, \\pi)$ but we will use $\\mathbf{x}^* = (0,0)$). For more on the Easom function, see this page [https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/easom.html](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/easom.html).\n",

    "## Framework approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will solve the problem in two different ways:\n",
    "1. using the closed-loop approach of the `.auto`-method\n",
    "2. using the iterative optimization approach of the framework which requires using the methods `.ask` and `.tell`. This approach allows for iterative optimization and optimization of any callable function, known or otherwise.\n",

    "Installation of `torch` and `torchvision` (required dependencies) cannot be bundled as part of the `creative_project` installable. This is unfortunate, but a known issue it seems. Therefore these must be installed first, before installing `creative_project`."
