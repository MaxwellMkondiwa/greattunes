NOTE: installing torch and torchvision via dependencies with setuptools is proving difficult. Seems it's unable to
resolve the dependecies of torch distributions (seems to be well-known issue from online investigations).

Currently users will have to first install torch and torchvision before installing this package. Upside is that this
will allow users to install the version of torch that suits their need of hardware and operating system.

More details on installing torch is given in README.md or by following this link:
